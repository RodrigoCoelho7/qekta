# QEKTA: Quantum Efficient Kernel Target Alignment

This repo provides the code for implementing trainable quantum embedding kernels using the Nystr√∂m Approximation method (or not). This allows for efficient quantum kernel implementations that scale only linearly with the training dataset size ```N``` in its entire pipeline, from training to the generation of the training kernel matrix that is fed to the SVM.
